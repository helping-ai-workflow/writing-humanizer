"""bump_version.py — sync the version across every declared plugin manifest.

Adapted from helping-ai-workflow/tripwork (MIT).

Driven by .version-bump.json (files[] with type/key, current, next,
audit.exclude). Handles json (incl. nested dotted keys), toml (pyproject
version line), and the CHANGELOG top heading.

Usage:
  bump_version.py --check      Report each declared version; non-zero on drift.
  bump_version.py --audit      Grep tracked repo for the current version in any
                               undeclared, non-excluded file (a missed manifest).
  bump_version.py X.Y.Z        Write every json/toml key = X.Y.Z, advance
                               current/next, then audit.

    # file that merely *mentions* the previous version would make --audit noisy at
    # every release, and a noisy gate gets turned off. Only a manifest — a file
    # that is supposed to carry THE version, the same shape as files[] entries —
    # sitting at the previous version is an actual defect (TW-078: it means the
    # file was never declared in .version-bump.json files[], so bump() never wrote
    # it, and it silently stayed on the old version).
    #
    # Detection window is exactly one release wide, by design (not a history log —
    # that's scope creep `bump()` never signed up for). `previous` only ever holds
    # the ONE version being bumped FROM. A manifest flagged here and not fixed
    # before the *next* bump becomes invisible again: the next bump() call rolls
    # `previous` forward to the version that was `current` at that bump, and the
    # stuck manifest matches neither the current-version scan nor the new
    # previous-version scan. This is acceptable, not dangerous, only because
    # `bump()` ends with `return audit(root)` (verified: a manifest stuck at the
    # version being bumped FROM makes bump() itself exit non-zero — see
    # test_bump_returns_nonzero_when_undeclared_manifest_stuck_at_previous_version).

    # only walk past it by never running bump() at all, which is the same failure
    # mode --check/--audit already have.
